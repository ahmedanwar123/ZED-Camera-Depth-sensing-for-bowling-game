# Project Name: ZED-Camera-Depth-sensing-for-bowling-game
This project is a bowling game played using the Zed Camera Depth Sensor. The Zed Camera is a stereo camera that provides depth perception by capturing two synchronized images from two different viewpoints. It allows us to calculate the depth of objects in the scene and use that information to create interactive applications like games.

## Prerequisites
